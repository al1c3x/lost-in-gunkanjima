This is one of the games that my team won the "best game" in a game jam. The game is made in Unity and the platform is 3D and the shader used is URP. The game theme is "lost and found" and the genre is "horror". The game mechanic is simple, there will be a game master at the beginning of the game then she will provide you a riddle that the answer is the thing that you need to find in the setting that we're in. The player must move around his/her environment to look for the item that the headmaster is requesting and bring it back to her.
